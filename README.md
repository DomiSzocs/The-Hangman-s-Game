# The Hangman's Game
My first big project. I wrote it by the end of 12th grade, without knowing much about web programming. It was written with the MAP stack, MySQL, Apache, PHP.
The game is the standard Hangman's game. There are two players; one is thinking of a word; the other tries to guess it. The game is in Hungarian, including the filenames and the comments, and some of the variables.
The database with the words are included by the name of adatbazisok.sql
