# The Hangman's Game
My first big project. I wrote it by the end of the 12th grade, without knowing much about web programing. It was written with the MAP stack, MySQL, Apache, PHP.
The game is the standard Hangman's game. There is two players, one is thinking of a word, the other tries to guess it. The game is in hungarian, including the filenames and the comments, and some og the variables.
